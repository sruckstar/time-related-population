# time-related-population
The mod regulates the density of traffic and the number of pedestrians depending on the time of day. So at night there will be few people and cars on the streets, and in the morning the streets will get busier, reaching a maximum in the evening rush hour.

At the moment this mod is not compatible with my other mod - Limited Population. A patch for this mod will be released soon.
